# Costa Linda Water Stewardship Initiative: Native Plant Outreach

[View Executive Summary](EXECUTIVE%20SUMMARY%20(2).PDF)

## Project Overview

This repository documents a data-driven public outreach and education program designed for the fictional **Costa Linda Water Department**. The initiative promotes water conservation by encouraging residential property owners to transition from traditional lawns to native, drought-adapted plants.

This project was developed to demonstrate proficiency in synthesizing complex data, creating educational materials, and delivering persuasive public presentationsâ€”core requirements for the Public Information Representative I position.

## Key Findings and Program Goal

The project's foundational analysis proved a core challenge in urban water management:

* **The Problem:** While large users (like a single golf course) have a high intensity of water use per acre, **residential landscaping accounts for the largest cumulative share (over 65%)** of a typical town's outdoor water consumption. This usage generates high volumes of runoff that are lost to the ocean rather than recharging the local watershed.
* **The Goal:** Design a targeted rebate program to reduce residential outdoor water use by 30% over five years.

## Skills Demonstrated

| Skill Area | Tool Used | Deliverable | PIR I Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Synthesis & Analysis** | **Excel** (Cleaning, Calculated Fields), **SQL** (Mock Verification) | Cleaned CSV data showing usage across four categories (Residential, Golf, Park, Commercial). | Ability to absorb and translate technical water data. |
| **Geospatial Visualization** | **ArcGIS Online** | Mock map layer identifying residential areas with the highest Runoff Severity Scores (R-Scores) to guide targeted outreach. | Expertise in translating data to visual communication. |
| **Visual Communication** | **Canva** | High-impact, actionable flyer designed for public consumption, featuring a QR code linked to the dashboard. | Design and production of environmental stewardship materials. |
| **Public Presentation** | **Presentation Script** | Script for a City Council presentation, focused on using data (Tableau/ArcGIS) to justify program funding and budget approval. | Making persuasive presentations to internal and external stakeholders. |

## Next Steps

The next phase of this project would involve developing a **program evaluation framework** to measure the actual reduction in water usage (ROI) in the residential areas targeted by the rebate program.
